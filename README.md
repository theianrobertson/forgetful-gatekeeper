# The Forgetful Gatekeeper

A little project I've been playing around with.  Here's the idea:
1. You want to take a break from some site
2. You open up the site password change interface in one tab, and forgetful gatekeeper in another
3. Enter a pass phrase in FG, and a date to forget until, and click "generate"
4. That generates a random password, and copies it to the clipboard.  Probably show the password in a mostly-greyed out text box or something
5. Paste the password into your site password change interface
6. ... do other things, because you don't know your password so you can't login
7. Come back x days later, and it'll retrieve the password based on your pass phrase
8. If you try to come back earlier, it'll say something silly like "oops I can't remember that yet give me a few more days"
